# nb.com-v8
Version 8 because I've made quite a few web previous versions of my webpage, and I've lost count


# Overview
The aim of this project is to showcase any projects or activties I have done or am doing.


# make sure to build first!
npm install
bower install

(you should be good to go)

# run the app locally
python -m SimpleHTTPServer

Now, go to localhost:8000 in your browser and the page will show



#Other notes:
This project is made with Angular.js (1 not 2) and has no back-end so that it can run in a very cost effective way.
