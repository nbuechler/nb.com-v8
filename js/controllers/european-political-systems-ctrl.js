Many Britons pride themselves on only one land invasion in its long history. It has, therefore, a democratic institution that has withstood the test of time, at least for a millennium..."

Traditionally, as of the formation of the 5th Republic in France, the Executive has considerably more decision-making potential than its prior counterparts. Sarkozy; however, fulfilling the position, is reduced to the painstaking political game of appeasing the French population in an attempt earn a second term..."

His ratings are down, his policies are not being enacted, and his legitimacy overall as a leader is falling. This situation is occurring not only in Italy, but also internationally, and as a result, many scholars believe that he may not survive as Prime Minister for much longer...."

Usually this is a member of the United Russia Party. In fact, the political system does not look very legitimate from an outside perspective.
