    <p>First, it's a very fascinating read, and there are quite a few points that are worthwhile, but then there are some that are questionable.</p>
    <p>Second, I too, in high school and throughout my 'fine arts' experiences was taught that black(#000) is not a *real* color - it's just a perception. At the crux, the author Kevin Marks is advocating for contrast, but I believe Marks overlooks the other 'Principles of Design'. (see: Bauhaus - <a style="color: white" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bauhaus">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bauhaus</a>). I think as artists will use a combination of brown and blue to make shadow in their medium, the designer is then inspired/motivated of the trend that the Marks is mentioning. This trend is to make the experience better by making the interface softer on the eyes, or more aesthetically pleasing, etc. Thus, we UI/UX 'experts' in our medium avoid the highest contrast because it causes 'eye strain', and we might make things blue and not red or green because of color blindness (and blue is also a calming color). By the way, I put experts in quotes because what the author Marks doesn't mention is that it all depends on the end user, and even the most expert of us all has a challenge predicting every possible scenario, even with some nice guidelines.</p>
    <p>In fact - on the topic of usability and predicting the end user, I am red shifting my screen. As you probably know, my text I'm typing will look different than what the UX/UI person(s) intended. The 'black' I see is red-black and the 'white' I see is red-tinted-white. I make the text look softer because I can, but some users don't have this ability. So, user interface preferences would be a neat feature, but it's also not as common of a paradigm on a cultural level, and therefore user interface preferences are not as common as you might think (out there in the wild). When you give the user control, you might be surprised how they make the software easier to use. I've seen user interface preferences a successful feature in almost every software it's included in.</p>
    <p>Marks is speaking from a position of a subclass of users - those who remember a high contrast web  - and those users like white pages with black font for whatever reason. Some of those reasons are great, and his 'workflow' or experiences should absolutely NOT be ignored by Google/Apple/etc. Hence, that is why configuration/user interface preferences are important. Squinting at a screen is not what users come to pages for. So, when a user squints, Marks is correct to say that the interface needs improvement.</p>
    <p>But, I think Marks misses some of the points about how software has become more bespoke - especially with HTML5 - and that it is often designed first for the biggest user share. It just so happens in this case, Kevin Marks is part of the smaller user group, and sometimes its not so fun to be part of the less noticed users. Marks fails to mention how most modern, well-made, webapps will make use of scalable fonts such as 'ems', and Marks fails to mention that changing of color has been a way that even print designers will make parts of page conform to a text hierarchy. Just like landscape painting, the gray objects are perceptually 'moved' to the back. On a screen, this means that the most important items are 'pulled' forward to the user.</p>
    <p>I'm also not a big fan of the title because it sounds like as a physicist, Marks has had one too many designers make fun of his excel spreadsheet. But in all seriousness, the title is more than an exaggeration. The web is not unreadable - at least, not as a whole.</p>
    <p>Lastly, the biggest take away for me is that Kevin Marks brings up some great points about contrast, one of 7 design principles depending on how you count. For reference, this site lists them out pretty nicely: <a style="color: white" href="http://www.johnlovett.com/test.htm">http://www.johnlovett.com/test.htm</a></p>
    <p>Making a good design and/or experience isn't that different than designing/writing a good or even great piece of software. It is really about building a good system and trying to balance parts of that system so it is efficient for its goal.</p>
