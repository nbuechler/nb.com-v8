              I wonder what would have happened if I didn't ever learn how to take professional pictures. Would I see the world the same way? I became inspired to capture the perfect shots ever since I was told I had an eye for capturing images. I've decided to value photography as the intersection of my visually artistic goals.

              In high school, I always felt very lucky to practice dark room photography, and I was also very excited when my parents got me a professional digital camera. It was at the beginning of my senior year of high school, and I used the Nikon D60 to capture images that I used in a guide book I was making for my internship.

              Photography for me has been a science more than an art because of its sophisticated process and methods. With either dark room or digital photography, I learned that there are quite a few concepts that are borrowed from the design world. The inspiration comes from the art world.

              I appreciate the intersection between journalism and photography, I like the idea of telling story though film. Photography is very similar, and I think it has a great power behind it, and I hope I can use my skill to benefit others.

              I learned that my photographic abilities are useful in making meaning for myself and other, and I think it is important to remember that today is just part of an ongoing series of meanings. When I think about a photograph, sometimes I remember that it is only a snapshot of time, and not the real thing.
