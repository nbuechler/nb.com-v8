              I had an interest in speaking German for a few reasons. As my second language, it was another way for me to speak with my Oma, or my mom's mom. I wanted to take Russian in high school because it was listed as a course. But like Italian, my second choice, Russian was only a course on paper. I enjoyed learning German.
            </h6>

              I felt grateful that I could understand other cultures, especially ones that were in my family. I was excited to understand those of distant cultures that I've never lived in. And, I'm excited to learn languages that I do not know yet.
            </h6>
            <h6>
              I have found that there is an underpinning structure to human language. That structure comes out clearly when we reference the idea of a language family, and cultures adapt to find their role in how they use their chosen language.
            </h6>
            <h6>
              Now, language is a doorway into cultures of the world. I don't find the differences anymore. I find the similarities. Instead of seeing an enemy, I try to see misunderstood friends.
            </h6>
            <h6>
              Pragmatic and semantic meanings often confuse us humans, because our ambiguous way of communicating allows us to trick each other. But, it also means that we rely on trust. And, it also means that we can find ways to enhance trust.
